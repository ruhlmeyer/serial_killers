# Serial Killer Analysis

Spencer, 

It was lovely meeting you in Austin the other day for Hannah's party, which she totally planned and then rudely forgot about.

After our discussion about serial killers being the existential threat of our time, I decided to spend a little bit of time doing an analysis.  For this project, I've scraped data from the Wikipedia page. There is a well known dataset on Kaggle, but I decided that I'd just go ahead and scrape the data as the kaggle data set only has about 300 rows, and wikipedia had over 800.

I hope you enjoy it.

Together, we will ensure that people take this threat more seriously.
