    "I really enjoyed speaking with you in Austin about the existential threat of serial killers, and I completely agree that people are not taking this seriously enough.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to do a little big of digging to see what kind of threat we face.  There is a faily well known dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vesuvius13/serial-killers-dataset) that many people will use to make observations about serial killers.  However, that data is 3 years old.  Instead I decided to scrape the data from [This Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims).  It appears to be the same dataset, just more up to date.  By scraping the data, I have additional 500+ rows to work with.\n",

    "I've included all of my code as well as the `requirements.txt` file in this repo, so feel free to expirement.  Together, we will get to the bottom of this."
